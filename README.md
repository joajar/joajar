I work as a software developer, having almost 3 years of commercial experience in developing, maintaining and integrating applications.

- ðŸ‘¯ Currently Iâ€™m looking for a new project, where my analitical and quick learning skills would be useful.
- ðŸ”­ Professionally, Iâ€™ve been working with <b>Java, Spring, Hibernate</b> and other ORMs, as well as various databases (<b>MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle</b>). What regards frontend, I've been working with <b>Angular</b>, Thymeleaf, JSP, and other template engines (e.g. one was drived by <b>Clojure</b>).
- ðŸ’¬ Previously I was a mathematician (earned PhD on stochastic dynamics and applied mathematics for a PhD thesis entitled "On stability of Markov operators and its applications in biomathematics and in the theory of iterated function systems") and an actuary (i.e. data scientist in insurance) so you may ask me about those areas. And about software development of course.
