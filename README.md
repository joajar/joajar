- ðŸ‘¯ Currently Iâ€™m looking for a project with <b>microservices</b>, where my <b>Full Stack Spring/Angular</b> skills would be useful.
- ðŸ”­ Professionally, Iâ€™ve been working with <b>Java, Spring, Hibernate</b> and other ORMs, as well as various databases (<b>MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle</b>). What regards frontend, I've been working with <b>Angular</b>, Thymeleaf, JSP, and other template engines (e.g. one was drived by <b>Clojure</b>).
- ðŸ’¬ Previously I was a mathematician (earned PhD on stochastic dynamics) and an actuary (i.e. data scientist in insurance) so you may ask me about those areas. And about software development of course.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <b>microservices</b> and <b>DDD</b>.
